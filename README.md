What is Sanity?
----------------

Sanity is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Sanity uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Sanitycore is the software which
enables the use of the currency SANITY.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Sanity core software, see https://www.sanity.mn.
